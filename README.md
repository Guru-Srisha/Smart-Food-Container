# Smart Food Container

A real-time IoT solution designed to monitor and control food parameters during long-distance shipments. This system helps avoid spoilage by enabling live tracking of temperature, humidity, gas levels, and more. Stakeholders can remotely control the temperature conditions—whether hot or cold—through an integrated IoT cloud dashboard.

### Features

- **Live Monitoring**: Track temperature, humidity, ammonia levels, weight and more during transit.
- **Temperature Control**: Remotely adjust and maintain the shipment environment.
- **IoT Cloud Integration**: View data and control settings in real time via Blynk IoT Cloud.
- **NFC-Enabled Access**: Instantly access shipment data and controls with one tap.
- **Spoilage Prevention**: Uses color sensors to detect the change in color to detect if the food is rotting, alerts stakeholders take action before perishable goods degrade.
